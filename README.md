The confirmation_cracker will show you the connections between K0--K2. The full_password_slider goes through Kryptos step by step in an attempt to confirm there are no additional passwords hidden within this manner. A kryptos scanner that proves how Sanborn originally intended K1 and K2 to be solved, includes an extended english crib list and K3-K4 for future crib scanning. Only K2 verified currently. Additional possible cribs have been added, but only further verified the initial solution methods for K1 and K2. Full details below.

K1 is solved via dissection of the morse code from K0 and does not need this system to solve.

Steps:
Write out morse code drop final two blocks, list the first mirrors and middle letter for each mirror:

Line (left → right scan)	first mirror you meet	middle letter
EEVIRTUALLYE	LL	L
EEEEEEINVISIBLE	ISI	S
DIGETALEEE	none (skip)	–
INTERPRETATIT	ERPRE (length 5)	P
(same word) … TAT …	TAT	A
(same word) … TIT	TIT	I
EESHADOWEE	AHA	H (we’ll not use H)
FORCESEEEEE	ESE	S
LUCIDEEE	DEE (even pair)	E? (we’ll grab a better M in a second)
MEMORYE	MEM	E
(same word) MEME…	EME	M
POSITIONE	ITI	T
SOS	SOS	(O – not needed)
Result:

PALIMHSEST E vs PALIMPSEST

Obviously, this is just a misspelling of the actual key needed to solve K1 but it would be more than enough to get started as it’s already really close. That necessary tweak to the spelling is an easily conquered hurdle.

This is the simplest method for getting water out of the rocks of K0 for K1.

A more convoluted method to solve K1 without a key comes from using a similar method as K2 with extra steps. Standard running alphabet, no mods, kryptos as a key. Write encrypted text, write Kryptos beneath, subtract the values for a new string of encrypted letters. Then evaluate each column as a new puzzle, where each letter in the column becomes a new shift based on its correspondence to the letter E, this allows you to get a vowel+bigram+trigram score from each column. Rank the winners, then take the top letter from each column and do the same subtraction math we’ve been doing. But honestly, at that point, you might as well brute force it. So I wouldn’t count on this being the intention.
